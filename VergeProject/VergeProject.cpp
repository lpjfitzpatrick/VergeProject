// This below way will not always give the best solution, but I believe it should ways get a
// feasible one. To get the best solution maybe we have to use a bitmask. I might look into that
// after I get the first way working

// One way is to use a BFS and greedily choose the best (smallest weight) edge from a starting node
// The starting node can be any node on the graph since we know the graph is complete (and
// will always be able to get to every node once without backtracking). But since we are considering
// node in pairs, we can pick any pair and then pick the best edge from edges in that pair. The
// node which has that edge will be our start.
// We keep track of what has been visisted using a vector of bools. Visited one entry in a pair
// will visited both.
// We can use a priority queue to keep the smallest weight edge at the front of our queue. This
// should give constant access time and then we can take that edge if it leads somewhere that hasn't
// been visited yet.
